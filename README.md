# About me

**elfstoni/elfstoni** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

ðŸ§  I'm Bianca, a psychology student currently navigating the realms of academia and professional development.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm actively engaged as a sourcing and recruitment intern, where I leverage my skills and understanding of human psychology to connect talented individuals with exciting opportunities.

ðŸŽ¨ When I'm not immersed in academic or professional endeavors, I enjoy painting, which serves as a creative outlet and keeps me balanced.

Let's connect, collaborate, and learn together! Feel free to explore my work here and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bianca-valterova/) to continue the conversation.
